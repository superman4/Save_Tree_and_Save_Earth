# Save_Tree_and_Save_Earth
spark ar filter 
## Inspiration
        Trees have long been a subject of interest and a topic of discussion  and it's no wonder ,
        they represent life, growth, peace, and nature.
      That's why i made  this filter.

## What it does
        well this filter can  remind people that trees are not servants , they are your life partner 
        this filter will remind you what man kind did to trees and why they are so important in your life.
        filter goes like a story.   

## How I built it
        Asset creation
        1.downloaded 3d model from sketch fab via  in-build AR Library  {CC licence}
        2. created images using  Gimp 
        3.created audio using text to speech  using https://www.naturalreaders.com/online/ 
           audio compressed using 3rd party online service  https://www.compresss.com/compress-audio.html
        
            In Spark AR
         1. used patch editor  to change 3d object and audio playing in background
         2. used particle system for  oxygen and carbon dioxide in filter
         3. used patch editor for  animations , instructions and so on.
         4. images compressed manually for better experience  

## Challenges I ran into
      Spark AR BUG
      worst bug :- when i export it to spark hub and clicked on submit button then it says   not uploading #error 
                         in spark ar everything is good to upload  1-2 mb  file size , tried several times. Didn't uploaded 
                         Then after several days of hangover  , i replaced my assets  this time removed high-low-poly 3d object 
                          to low-lowpoly 3d object  , then  i'm able to submit it.
        Bug :-  Its not showing correct project size  , In my case my project size shown in spark ar  in asset summery is 
                    10mb but actual size is more than 40 mb , that is the reason  i cant submit it in hub 
                     Still this Bug is alive  
  
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
    we need to take care , who cared us , who protected us ..... most of the time history says  man kind didn't protected 
    people who raised them .  i'm happy if some one tried/watched  this filter , at-least one moment  they will think  
    about it.

## What I learned
      every time its a improvement , tried somany patch even i dont know how to use them ,  its like a jigsaw puzzle 
      connecting one node end up with errors then try next one until it solves . spark ar community is always helpful
      for  content creation , tips , cool developers...etc

## What's next for Save Tree  and Save Life
    creating  visual effects and improved visual experience  .
